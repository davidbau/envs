# Bash script to set up an anaconda python-based deep learning environment
# that has support for pytorch, tensorflow, pycaffe in the same environment,
# long with juypter, scipy etc.

# This should not require root.  However, it does copy and build a lot of
# binaries into your ~/.conda directory.  If you do not want to store
# these in your homedir disk, then ~/.conda can be a symlink somewhere else.
# (At MIT CSAIL, you should symlink ~/.conda to a directory on NFS or local
# disk instead of leaving it on AFS, or else you will exhaust your quota.)
